# Performance Analysis in Tokyo_Olympic

For years, Olympics have been held around the world, and participants from around the world compete to succeed in different sports. We wanted to work with this data because we want to look for answers to the questions about which countries are superior in which branches, which countries are leading women or men in which sports and bringing medals to their country. Dataset contains 15 variables. ID, number, gender, age, height, weight, Team, NOC, games, Year, season, city, sport, event and medal parameters are used in this dataset as variables.
